> A project template for building LLM (Large Language Model) applications.

## ✨ Features

- **Type Safety:** Leverages TypeScript (via `typescript`) to improve code quality and reduce runtime errors.
- **Validation with Zod:** Uses Zod (`zod`) for robust runtime data validation and schema definition.
- **Fast Development Workflow:** Utilizes Vite (`vite`) for quick server starts and hot module replacement during development.
- **Testing Ready:** Includes Vitest (`vitest`) for unit testing, indicating attention to code reliability.
- **AI Integration:** Built with AI-focused libraries like `@ai-sdk/openai` and `ai`, suggesting a focus on integrating large language models or AI-driven workflows.
- **Efficient Path Handling:** Employs `pathe` for cross-platform path manipulation, ensuring consistent file handling across environments.
- **Code Formatting:** Likely uses Prettier (`prettier`) for consistent code formatting, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Environment Configuration:** Includes `dotenv` for managing environment variables, enabling easy configuration of different environments (development, production, etc.).
- **Linting and Code Quality:** Incorporates ESLint (`eslint`) and Antfu’s ESLint configuration (`@antfu/eslint-config`) to enforce coding standards and best practices.

## 🚀 Getting Started
