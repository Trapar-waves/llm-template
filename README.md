> A production-ready template for LLM (Large Language Model) application development, integrating AI tools, TypeScript type safety, Zod validation, and modern dev utilities.

## ✨ Features

- **Type Safety:** Powered by TypeScript for compile-time type checking and enhanced code maintainability.
- **Runtime Validation:** Zod schema validation ensures data integrity across API endpoints and model interactions.
- **Rapid Development:** Vite-based dev server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for instant feedback during iteration.
- **Test-Driven:** Vitest integrated for fast unit testing, ensuring code reliability from development to production.
- **AI-Ready:** Pre-configured with AI SDKs (`@ai-sdk/openai`, `ai`) for seamless LLM integration and workflow automation.
- **Cross-Platform Paths:** `pathe` for consistent path handling across Windows/macOS/Linux environments.
- **Code Consistency:** Prettier formatting and Antfu's ESLint rules enforce standardized code style.
- **Environment Management:** `dotenv` for secure configuration of API keys and environment-specific settings.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Development:** Provides TypeScript language support, Vite development server, and Rslib build tooling for strict type checking, fast hot module replacement, and optimized production builds.
- **AI Integration:** Integrates OpenAI API client and AI workflow utilities to support large language model interactions and AI-driven feature development.
- **Validation & Quality:** Includes Zod runtime schema validation, ESLint code quality enforcement, and Prettier formatting tools to ensure code integrity and consistency.
- **Development:** Contains Vitest testing framework, Pathe path manipulation, Dotenv environment variable management, and other development utilities to support comprehensive project requirements.
